This project uses swim times pulled from usaswimming.com to graphically represent a swimmer's progress over the period of time defined by that set of times. A user can search for a swimmer in the database, choose an official event that they may have swam, and choose between short-course-yards or long-course-meters competiiton pools. After selecting required credentials, a graph of the chosen swimmer's times is presented with date of race on the x-axis and time of the event in seconds on the y-axis. The time range spans all of the times inputed into the psql table.

Changed Features and Goals:
-- Exporting was not implemented. 
-- Changing time range was not implemented – it looked better to show the whole swimmer's career. 


Would Have Been Helpful Information: 
-- An easy way to debug javascript
-- Knowing of the existence of jqplot. 

Program used to create times table
<a href="tables.sql">Tables.sql</a>
We also created another table with just names and ID numbers, for lookup in the times table, however we did this manually.
